    <article id="tribute-info">
      <p>Sometime around 1583, a little girl named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nzinga_of_Ndongo_and_Matamba" target="_blank" id="tribute-link">Nzinga Mbande</a> was born. Hers was not an easy entry into the world; legend has it she was born with her umbilical cord around her neck. Many villagers believed that individuals born in this manner would grow up to be proud, powerful people. So too the story goes that a village wise woman told Nzinga’s mother that her daughter would grow up to be queen.</p>

      <p>It wasn’t exactly a shot-in-the-dark prophecy, though. Nzinga’s father was the King of Ndongo, one-half of Angola’s divided nation. As she grew up, Nzinga was privy to how her father ruled, and she became invested in the struggle the people of Ndongo faced with their enemies, the Kongo.</p>

      <p>All of this transpired at a time when Portuguese missionaries had identified Angola as a prime target for the slave trade. The king at first worked with the Portuguese to arrange a slave trade — on the condition that they spare his people.</p>

      <p>Upon the king’s death, however, the Portuguese saw no reason to continue to honor the arrangement. They proceeded to throw his son in jail and took control of the kingdom.</p>

      <p>Nzinga was not content to sit idly by and let the Portuguese remain in power. The story goes that she went straight to the Portuguese governor’s office with the intention of demanding not only the safe return of her brother but the release of Angola’s people from slavery.</p>

      <p>The governor refused to offer Nzinga a chair. So, Nzinga — who, at any given time had upwards of 50 male servants at her service — told a servant to get down on the ground to create a perch upon which she could sit. Upon settling onto the servant’s back, Nzinga proceeded to launch into her negotiations.</p>

      <p>When the discussion ended, Nzinga told the servant to stand, at which point she slit his throat in front of the Portuguese governor. Realizing, perhaps, that they were dealing with someone far more powerful than they realized, the Portuguese government acquiesced and returned her brother.</p>
